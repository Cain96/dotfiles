# Actively Utilize Skills and Subagents

## When to Use Each

- **Skill**: Tasks requiring specialized knowledge → Read `SKILL.md` before starting work and apply the procedures/constraints as specified. Do not just declare it; actually use it.
- **Subagent**: Tasks where independent context is beneficial (refactoring, reviews, broad exploration, etc.) or when you want to delegate for parallel execution.

※ Both can be used together. You may pass Skill knowledge to a Subagent for execution.
※ For small tasks where no relevant Skill/Subagent exists, proceed with the normal flow.

## Explicit Declaration When Using

When using a Skill/Subagent, explicitly state which one you're using and why in one line before proceeding.
